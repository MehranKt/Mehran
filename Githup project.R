#But the x-axis of the bar plot doesn't have to be the continent: you can instead create a bar plot where each bar represents a country.

# In this exercise, you'll create a bar plot comparing the GDP per capita between the two countries in the Oceania continent (Australia and New Zealand).

# Instructions

# Filter for observations in the Oceania continent in the year 1952.

# To make the histogram more informative, you can try putting the x-axis on a log scale.
